## Overview

Discovering camouflaged objects is a challenging task in computer vision due to the high similarity between camouflaged objects and their surroundings. While the problem of camouflaged object detection over sequential video frames has received increasing attention, the scale and diversity of existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) datasets are greatly limited, which hinders the deeper analysis and broader evaluation of recent deep learning-based algorithms with data-hungry training strategy. To break this bottleneck, in this paper, we construct CAMotion, a high-quality dataset covers a wide range of species for camouflaged motion object detection in the wild. CAMotion comprises various sequences with multiple challenging attributes such as uncertain edge, occlusion, motion blur and shape complexity, etc. The sequence annotation details and statistical distribution are presented from various perspectives, allowing CAMotion to provide in-depth analyses on the camouflaged object's motion characteristics in different challenging scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing SOTA models on CAMotion dataset, and discuss the major challenges in VCOD tasks. We will release our dataset soon, hoping our dataset leads to further advancements in the research community.
